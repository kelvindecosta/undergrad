# Computer Networks

> A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes, which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology. Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pair or fiber-optic cables, or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.
